Unfortunatly, I was not able to complete this project. After spending countless hours this week reading through documentation,
I have decided to hand in an uncompleted version of the game.

My first thought was to use HTML and CSS with Node.js to link between the front and back-end. This is something
I have done in the past with projects and other games. Where I got lost was trying to use the API.
It was very difficult to access the twitter api using node, and I kept running into errors where I was accessing
my tweet_array before the API had finished executing.

I then decided to scrap this stack after a few days and switch to Python. I have never used Python as a back-end before,
and decided to work with Flask and tweepy. This was easier than node but ultimatly there were too many new technologies and too 
much unfamiliar syntax for me to complete the project.

That being said, I learned a ton about Python and working with API's which was all new to me. I appreciate the opportunity to work on this project
and would love to have another chance to join Change++ if given the opportunity. 

The code from my python implementation is in the app folder.

Thanks,
Henrik
